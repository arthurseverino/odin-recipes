    <h3> Description: </h3> 
    
    <p> Easy-to-make chicken with a little variation. 
        Great on the grill but just as good baked in the 
        oven when you can't grill out.
    </p> 
    <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li> 
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li> 2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li> 8 slices bacon </li>
        <li> 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li> ¾ cup barbeque sauce (such as Cattlemen's® or Jack Daniel's®)</li>
        <li> Salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li> 
        <li>Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until the edges begin to crisp, 
            about 5 minutes; drain bacon on paper towels. Wrap each chicken breast with 
            2 slices of bacon in an x-shaped pattern and place into the prepared baking 
            sheet with bacon ends underneath.</li> 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; spread barbeque sauce over chicken 
            breasts and bake until the juices run clear, the chicken is no longer pink inside, 
            and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast 
            reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 10 to 15 more minutes. </li>
    </ol>
