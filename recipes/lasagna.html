    <h3> Description: </h3>
    
    <p> This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This 
        is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.
    </p> 
    <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li> 
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck </li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li> 
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li> 2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li> Salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop 
            on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), 
            so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li> 
        <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground 
            beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li> 
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li> Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. </li> 
        <li> Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. 
            You can reheat it in a conventional oven or microwave</li>
    </ol>
